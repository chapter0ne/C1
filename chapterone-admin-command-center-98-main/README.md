# ChapterOne Admin Command Center

**Migration Notice:**

This project is being migrated from using Supabase (Postgres, Auth, RLS) to a custom backend built with **Express.js** and **MongoDB**. All admin operations, authentication, and data management will be handled by a new RESTful API server located in the `backend/` directory.
